### Easy command installation

```

sudo apt install git -y
sudo apt install ansible -y

git clone https://github.com/gllrmzndm/Advanced_Engine_Management_Guillermo.git

cd Advanced_Engine_Management_Guillermo

ansible-playbook  ansibleplaybook.yml --ask-become-pass

```

Playbook needs to be changed to work with Fedora, only the module name from apt to dng is enough I guess.
